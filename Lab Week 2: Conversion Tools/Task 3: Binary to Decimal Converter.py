# when doing this code, I immediately thought that there had to be a better way than the way you explained it in class by doing a bunch of math. I decided to ask AI about it, but I specifically told it not to give me the answer because I actually wanted to figure it out for myself. What I learned is that there is a better way. Apparently, there's a particular line of code that I can use in order to translate it from a base 2 system into the decimal base 10. In the `binary_2_decimal` section, I was able to put the integer as binary in base 2 and tell Python to translate it into a normal number. I was able to do the opposite for the decimal to binary. I learned that `bin` actually stood for binary, which I thought was kind of cool. Using line 5 was a little more tricky, but I was able to eventually figure it out after watching a YouTube video.
